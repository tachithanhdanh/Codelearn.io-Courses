# Description

After nearly two years of abandonment, I decided to take another course on Codelearn.io platform to apply my knowledge of Object Oriented Programming in C++ to solve practical problems. I will use this course as a place to review what I have learned for several weeks. 

I think this is my last course (besides Accelerated Computer Science Fundamentals Specialization on Coursera) about C++ before jumping into the next language, which is Java, so I decided to make a speedrun on this course to set a milestone with this amazing programming language.

# Certificate

I haven't started this course yet but the certificate will be here soon.
