# Description

This is my first ever course on **Codelearn.io**. I remember that I took this course after I had read several lessons on **[daynhauhoc C++ series](cpp.daynhauhoc.com)**.

An interesting fact about this course is that I completed it in only **two days**. What an impressive amount of time!!
